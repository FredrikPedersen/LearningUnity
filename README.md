# Learning Unity

Repo for various smaller projects used to learn how to work with Unity.

The following projects are taken from the [Complete C# Unity Developer 3D: Learn to Code Making Games](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/) course, by **Ben Tristem** and **Rick Davidson** on Udemy:

 - First Steps
 - Terminal Hacker
 - Project Boost

Most projects may deviate from the source material in the course to fit my own coding style and structure.
